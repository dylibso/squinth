TODO: REMOVE --- DEV NOTE! use these sites to help set up your twitch variables

USE TWITCH-CLI app that twitch provides to get your oauth token, run "twitch configure" with CLIENT id and CLIENT secret, then run "twitch token" to get a new OAUTH
look at your dev console to get the CLIENT ID of your app that is used to generate the oauth

the  !!!! USER ID !!! is DIFFERENT THAN THE CLIENT ID, client id is just for the app and for generating oauth. This is a number assoc. with your account. Use this to find it (I'm sure there is another way)

WAIT NEVERMIND I USED A TWITCH TOKEN GENERATOR THAT I CONNECTED TO MY TWITCH ACCOUNT, I dont think we will wanna use this with the official dylibso account, but I have no idea how this stuff works and I'm pissed off

# sQuinth by Extism!

A demonstration of collaborative audio programming via XTP, Extism, VCV Rack, and Twitch 

----- TODO: OLD DOCS -----
## What? Why?

This is an experiment to see if a VCV Rack plugin can be written in a language other than C++ via Web Assembly with the help of Extism. The idea occurred to me after a very short googling session seemed to suggest almost all audio programming is done in C++. It probably makes sense to program audio in C++ and there is no reason for anyone to switch, but hell, why not investigate ways to inject different languages into C++ infrastructure.

## Quick Start

Currently only tested on linux, but if you'd like to create scripts on your platform that do what the .sh files in here do then it should work for you. If you are non-linux visit the [install page for Extism](https://extism.org/docs/install/) to get started.

Download and install all prerequisites:
```
./get_prereqs.sh
```

Set your Rack User dir if it isn't already in your .bashrc. This is where the dirs that contain your patch files and your plugins live.
```
export RACK_USER_DIR=/home/<user>/.local/share/Rack2
```

Build the plugin:
```
./rebuild_all.sh
```

## TODO

- weird thing where when the js template runs for a minute or two it becomes glitched in a random looking way and cpu usage drops to zero, but calls to extism guest funcs is still reporting success codes...
- Implement examples in a couple more languages?
- Implement more complex, varied wave types
